        <h3>Installation of Flask and Building the Webpage ðŸ‘€</h3>
        <p>
            <p> To install flask, I first installed python and pip on my computer and did the following command in my terminal:<p> 
            <code> pip install flask <br><br></code>  
            
            In order to build the webpage, I had to create a python file in which it renders the html files and the css 
            styling. 
            In this python file, I had to define the home route (default URL of the page) and included a dictionary of 2 projects
            where they keys were the project attributes such as image, title, description. I also defined the reflection route
            where I had to indicate that the web page links to this reflection.html file. The rest of this webpage mainly consists
            of HTML and CSS programming. In these HTML files, Flask leverages Jinja 2 as its template engine to help render the HTML
            files dynamically. By using extend at the top of the HTML file, Flask understands that the current HTML template will inherit
            its content from another template. Another feature I had to use was block title, where it overrides the website title from the inherited
            template and changes that value. 
        </p>

        <h3>Journey of Struggles ðŸ˜“</h3>
        <p>
            I mainly had difficulties with understanding the app routing, and ensuring that it goes to the correct webpage. Additionally
            it was hard to display the specific images that I had defined in the python file within the html file itself. After a lot of 
            web browsing, I realized that I had to use {% raw %}{{}}{% endraw %} around the components in the HTML file. For instance, in the index.html file, I 
            had project["image"], but the webpage wasn't rendering it properly. Therefore, I had to include {% raw %}{{}}{% endraw %} around that component for it 
            to render correctly.
